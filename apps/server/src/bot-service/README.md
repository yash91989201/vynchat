# Stranger Chat Bot Service

A robust bot service for the VynChat stranger chat feature. Bots simulate real users to provide a better user experience during low-traffic periods.

## Overview

This service manages a pool of bot instances that:
- Join the matchmaking queue
- Engage in realistic conversations with real users
- Respond contextually to messages
- Gracefully handle connection issues
- Track analytics for optimization

## Architecture

### Components

1. **BotManager** (`bot-manager.ts`)
   - Manages the lifecycle of all bot instances
   - Dynamically adjusts bot count based on human user activity
   - Handles graceful startup and shutdown

2. **BotInstance** (`bot-instance.ts`)
   - Represents a single bot user
   - Manages Supabase Realtime connections (lobby, user, room channels)
   - Implements conversation logic and message generation
   - Handles matchmaking and room events

3. **SupabaseClient** (`supabase-client.ts`)
   - Configured Supabase client with optimized Realtime settings
   - Service role authentication for admin operations

## Key Features

### Robust Connection Handling
- **Exponential backoff** on connection failures
- **Retry logic** for critical operations (matchmaking queue, channels)
- **Graceful degradation** - continues operation even if some channels fail
- **Connection health monitoring** with automatic reconnection

### Smart Bot Pooling
- **Dynamic scaling** based on human user count
- **Staggered startup** (5-8 seconds between bots) to prevent connection storms
- **Configurable limits** via environment variables

### Realistic Behavior
- **Multiple personalities** (friendly, curious, humorous, intellectual)
- **Varied response times** based on typing speed simulation
- **Context-aware responses** using pattern matching
- **Natural conversation flow** with greetings, questions, and farewells

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url

# Optional - Bot Pool Configuration
BOT_MIN_COUNT=2              # Minimum bots to maintain (default: 2)
BOT_MAX_COUNT=8              # Maximum bots allowed (default: 8)
BOT_TARGET_PERCENTAGE=25     # Target percentage of bots vs humans (default: 25%)
MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL_MS=120000  # How often to check pool health (default: 120000ms / 2 minutes)
```

### Bot Profiles

Bots are randomly assigned profiles from `bot-profiles.ts`:
- **Alex** - Friendly, into movies, music, travel
- **Sam** - Curious, interested in science and books
- **Jordan** - Humorous, enjoys memes and sports
- **Taylor** - Intellectual, discusses philosophy and history
- **Casey** - Friendly, talks about fitness and cooking

## How It Works

### Startup Sequence

1. **Validation** - Checks required environment variables
2. **Bot Creation** - Creates bot user accounts in the database
3. **Channel Setup** - Establishes Realtime connections:
   - Lobby presence channel (for showing online status)
   - User channel (for receiving match notifications)
4. **Matchmaking** - Joins the stranger-queue via PostgreSQL PGMQ
5. **Ready** - Bot is now active and waiting for matches

### During a Match

1. **Match Notification** - Receives `stranger_matched` event via user channel
2. **Room Join** - Subscribes to room-specific Realtime channel
3. **Greeting** - Sends initial greeting message
4. **Conversation** - Responds to incoming messages with context-aware replies
5. **Exit** - Either:
   - Bot skips after reaching message limit
   - Partner leaves
   - Bot is skipped by partner

### Recovery & Error Handling

The service handles various failure scenarios:

- **Channel timeouts** - Retries with exponential backoff (up to 3 attempts)
- **Connection errors** - Continues without non-critical channels
- **Queue failures** - Retries queue operations with delays
- **Database errors** - Logs and continues for non-critical operations

## Improvements Made

### Connection Stability
âœ… Increased timeouts from 3s to 5s
âœ… Added exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)
âœ… Unique channel names per bot to avoid conflicts
âœ… Retry logic for all Realtime operations
âœ… Promise race conditions fixed with resolved flags

### Performance
âœ… Reduced connection storms by staggering bot startup (5-8s delays)
âœ… Optimized Realtime settings (10 events/second, proper heartbeat)
âœ… Disabled self-broadcast for efficiency
âœ… Parallel channel setup with Promise.allSettled

### Reliability
âœ… Graceful degradation when channels fail
âœ… Automatic room channel reconnection on errors
âœ… Better cleanup of channels on shutdown
âœ… More informative logging

### Configuration
âœ… Safer defaults (2 bots minimum instead of 3)
âœ… Configurable maintenance intervals
âœ… Better error messages

## Running the Service

### Development
```bash
cd apps/server
bun run bot-service
```

### Production
```bash
# Build first
bun run build

# Run with PM2 or similar process manager
pm2 start dist/bot-service/index.js --name "vynchat-bots"
```

### Docker
```dockerfile
# In your Dockerfile
CMD ["bun", "run", "src/bot-service/index.ts"]
```

## Monitoring

### Health Checks
The service logs bot stats every 60 seconds:
```
ðŸ“Š Bot Stats: {
  totalBots: 3,
  inConversation: 1,
  waiting: 2,
  isRunning: true
}
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Bot count vs target
- Connection errors
- Matchmaking queue size
- Average conversation duration
- Skip rates

## Troubleshooting

### Bots not starting
1. Check Supabase Realtime connection limits
2. Verify SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is correct
3. Check database connectivity
4. Review logs for specific errors

### Channel errors (CHANNEL_ERROR)
1. Check Supabase Realtime is enabled
2. Verify service role key has proper permissions
3. Check Realtime connection limits in Supabase dashboard
4. Consider reducing BOT_MIN_COUNT temporarily

### Bots not matching
1. Verify stranger-matchmaker function is running (cron job)
2. Check PGMQ extension is installed
3. Verify stranger-queue exists
4. Check bot user records in database

### High resource usage
1. Reduce BOT_MAX_COUNT
2. Increase MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL_MS
3. Check for memory leaks in logs
4. Review Supabase connection pool settings

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add more sophisticated conversation AI
- [ ] Implement topic-based conversation threading
- [ ] Add support for multiple languages
- [ ] Bot personality learning from successful conversations
- [ ] Integration with LLM for more natural responses

- [ ] Distributed bot service across multiple instances
- [ ] Real-time dashboard for bot monitoring

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the logs for error messages
2. Review Supabase dashboard metrics
3. Ensure all environment variables are set
4. Verify database schema is up to date
