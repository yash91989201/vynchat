# Bot Service Fixes for Stranger Chat

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Connection Storm Prevention
- **Problem**: Multiple bots connecting simultaneously caused CHANNEL_ERROR
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented staggered startup (5-8 second delays)
  - Added connection pooling with per-client limits
  - Reduced events per second to 10 for bots, 5 for matchmaker

### 2. Robust Error Handling
- **Problem**: Insufficient retry logic and poor error handling
- **Solution**:
  - Exponential backoff with jitter for retries
  - Intelligent retry logic based on error patterns
  - Graceful degradation when channels fail
  - Comprehensive error logging and monitoring

### 3. Connection Pool Management
- **Problem**: No connection resource management
- **Solution**:
  - Connection pool with per-client limits (max 10 connections)
  - Automatic cleanup of failed connections
  - Connection metrics and monitoring
  - Proper resource management on bot shutdown

### 4. Realtime Monitoring
- **Problem**: No visibility into connection health
- **Solution**:
  - Realtime connection monitoring with metrics
  - Connection state tracking for each channel
  - Performance monitoring (response times)
  - Automatic cleanup of stale connections

### 5. Matchmaker Improvements
- **Problem**: Matchmaker also suffered from connection issues
- **Solution**:
  - Better error handling for presence channels
  - Retry logic for user notifications
  - Reduced connection timeout (8 seconds)
  - Graceful degradation when presence fails

## Implementation Details

### Connection Pool (`supabase-client.ts`)
```typescript
// New connection pool with retry logic
await connectionPool.createChannelWithRetry(
  clientId,
  channelName,
  config,
  { maxRetries: 5, baseDelay: 2000, maxDelay: 10000 }
);
```

### Bot Instance Changes (`bot-instance.ts`)
- Staggered channel connections
- Better error handling for lobby presence
- Graceful degradation when channels fail
- Proper cleanup using connection pool

### Bot Manager Changes (`bot-manager.ts`)
- Longer delays between bot startups (5-8 seconds)
- Connection pool monitoring
- Better presence check handling

### Matchmaker Changes (`stranger-matchmaker/index.ts`)
- Improved channel creation with retry logic
- Better error handling for user notifications
- Reduced timeouts and retry counts

## Environment Variables

Add these to your bot service environment:

```bash
# Bot Service Configuration
BOT_MIN_COUNT=3
BOT_MAX_COUNT=15
BOT_TARGET_PERCENTAGE=30
MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL_MS=60000

# Supabase Configuration (Service Role for bots)
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

## Monitoring

The bot service now includes comprehensive monitoring:

```typescript
// Get connection pool stats
const stats = connectionPool.getStats();
console.log('Connection stats:', stats);

// Get detailed status
connectionPool.logDetailedStatus();
```

## Usage

1. Start the bot service with proper environment variables
2. Monitor the logs for connection status
3. Use the monitoring functions to track health
4. The service will automatically retry failed connections

## Expected Behavior

- Bots start with 5-8 second delays between each other
- Each bot attempts channel connections with exponential backoff
- Failed connections are retried up to 10 times
- Connection limits prevent resource exhaustion
- Graceful degradation when channels fail
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Troubleshooting

If you still see CHANNEL_ERROR:

1. Check Supabase connection limits in your dashboard
2. Verify service role key has proper permissions
3. Monitor connection pool stats for bottlenecks
4. Check logs for specific error patterns
5. Consider reducing bot count if hitting limits

## Performance Improvements

- Reduced connection storms through staggering
- Better resource utilization via pooling
- Faster recovery from network issues
- Reduced load on Supabase realtime infrastructure
